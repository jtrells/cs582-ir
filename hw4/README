Homework 4
Juan Trelles

1. Instructions
   Install the required packages numpy and nltk with pip3 numpy nltk
   Run: python3 src/run.py PATH_TO_ROOT_FOLDER IGNORE_NEW_LINES
   PATH_TO_ROOT_FOLDER Path to www collection (folder that contains the abstracts and gold folders)
   IGNORE_NEW_LINES 1 to consider the whole file as one sentence, 0 to respect the line breaks when forming n_grams

2. Files
   Graph: Simple class to keep the graph matrix for one document and the headers indices (word mapping to columns)
   hw4_utils: tokenizing util functions
   TextRank: PageRank implementation using matrix notation. Ranking stops by number of iterations or convergence. By
      default I'm using a tolerance of 1e-6.
   AbstractProcessor: Class that process a file, extracts tokens, creates n_grams, and calculates MRR for k=1 to 10 for
      the given file.
   hw4: Calculates the MRR of the collection. Each document returns a unit vector with the 10 values for the MRR given k.
      The function sums the columns and divides by the number of elements in the collection to get the MRR.
   hw4.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with an example run and a graph for the MRR.

3. About MRR
   For a given k, r is the first element that matches a value in the gold standard. Thus, if for k = i, r had a match,
   then all the elements k = i + 1, i + 2, ... will have the same value.

4. Test
   I tested the code on Windows and on the testing environment on bertvm.
